This is a webpage created as part of the assesment for "Programming for the Social Sciences".
On the top right, there are links to the relevant sections of the site:
 * [About!](u3ks.github.io/aboutme) - presents some information about me.
 * [Blog!](u3ks.github.io/blog) - the blog section of the website, with a sample blogpost
 * [Agent Based Model!](u3ks.github.io/abm) - gives a brief description of the agent based model implemented in the practicals and links to the code
 * [Mapper!](u3ks.github.io/mapper) - gives a brief description of the Mapper algorithm and the implementation of it. This is the second assignment.

This website uses the beutiful-jerkyl template. 
Other than that, I have written all the pages in markdown.
